# CRA Project Files

Install globally with `npm install -g init-cra`.

You can run `init-cra` in a fresh CRA repo to add these helper files.

## Options

### **_-s / --server_**

Applying this flag will install `express` and `body-parser`, along with creating a server folder and a basic Express API scaffold. This will also update your `package.json` file to start the server and proxy it to your CRA app.

### **_-nc / --no-commit_**

Applying this flag will skip automatically committing the files created and altered by init-cra
