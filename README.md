# CRA Project Files

This repo is for my own personal CRA app config. If you would like to use this, you can install it and add `alias init_cra="sh ~/repos/cra-project-files/import-project-files.sh"` to your startup script (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc)

You will need to modify `origin_dir` in `import-project-files.sh` to point to your own directory.
